# Rasterization App

## Overview
This project visualizes the process of rasterizing geometric shapes using JavaScript. The app demonstrates various algorithms for rasterizing lines and circles. It includes an interactive interface displayed in the browser.

## Features
- **Line Rasterization**: Displays lines using algorithms like StepByStep, DDA or Bresenham.
- **Circle Rasterization**: Rasterizes circles using Bresenham algorithm for circles.
- **Interactive Visualization**: A coordinate grid allows users to see how shapes are rendered pixel by pixel.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## How to Run the App
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder on your local machine.
3. Locate the `index.html` file.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (double-click the file or open it via your browser's menu).
